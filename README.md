Chatbot Feature

This portfolio includes an interactive chatbot built using JavaScript.
The bot responds to common questions such as:
“What is your GPA?”
“What programming languages do you know?”
“Tell me about your experience.”
“What projects have you completed?”
The chatbot opens from a floating button and appears as an on-page widget.

How it works:

Uses JavaScript event listeners
Stores questions and answers in a matching dictionary
Responds instantly without backend services
Works on both mobile and desktop

QR Code Integration

The homepage displays a QR code that links directly to the portfolio website.
You can also include this QR code in your resume to make it easier for others to access your portfolio on mobile devices.
